* Kernel
- A kernel is a square matrix that an image is multipled by
- Different kernels do different things
- can be used for edge detection, reducing noise, feature extraction, etc
** Identity
- Returns the original image

| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |

** Blur
- used to reduce noise

*** Gaussian Distribution
- What is?
*** Gaussian blur
#+attr_latex: :mode math :environment matrix
| 1/16 | 1/8 | 1/16 |
| 1/8  | 1/4 | 1/8  |
| 1/16 | 1/8 | 1/16 |

*** Gaussian blur larger
#+attr_latex: :mode math :environment matrix
| 1/256 | 1/64 | 3/128 | 1/64 | 1/256 |
| 1/64  | 1/16 | 3/32  | 1/16 | 1/64  |
| 3/128 | 3/32 | 9/64  | 3/32 | 3/128 |
| 1/64  | 1/16 | 3/32  | 1/16 | 1/64  |
| 1/256 | 1/64 | 3/128 | 1/64 | 1/256 |
** Edge Detection
- Gradients in images
  - Derivatives
- Good to blur before using edge detection
- TODO image
*** Sobel
- Gradient calculation
  - First derivative
- Edge detection
- Uses to kernels and combines the results
*** Right Sobel

* Thresholding
- Used before projection to get pixel we care about
- Used by both teams
  - Was in find blue from last week
** Binary
- set to max if threshold is reached

** Truncate
- set anything above threshold to the threshold

* Hough
- Express all points in polar coordinates
- Looks for overlapping lines to see what is a feature we care about
** Lines

** Circles

* OpenCV
- Has good documentation
- Use google to search
* Work
- Use the template to publish images
  - use whatever filter you want
