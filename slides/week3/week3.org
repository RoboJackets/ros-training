* What are we doing today?
- Encoders
- launch files
- Gazebo
	- urdf
- PID

* Encoders
#+BEGIN_NOTES
keep it high level. Do an example of ticks
#+END_NOTES
- used to determine the speed of a spinning wheel
	- measure number of ticks during a time step
- 2 main types
	- optical
	- magnetic

* Optical Encoders
#+BEGIN_NOTES
sensitive to dust and broken disks
#+END_NOTES
- uses a light and a glass wheel to measure ticks
- Things to watch out for

* Magnetic Encoders
#+BEGIN_NOTES
uses the hall effect
#+END_NOTES
- uses magnets to measure ticks
- generally low accuracy (lower tick count)
- requires occasional tuning

* Waveforms for Encoders
- TODO wavefroms encoders
* Launch Files
#+BEGIN_NOTES
mention how it can be more human understandable. Just a shorthand for rosrun
#+END_NOTES
- XML files
- a way to launch multiple ros nodes
- recursive

* Why Launch Files

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
rosrun igvc mapper ekf/base_link_frame=base_footprint mappter/topics=/scan/pointcloud /usb_cam_center/line_cloud /usb_cam_left/line_cloud
#+END_SRC
* Commandline
#+BEGIN_NOTES
make sure to mention tab complete
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
roslaunch [PACKAGE_NAME] FILE_NAME.launch
#+END_SRC

* Structure
- everything is encompassed in the launch tag
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
	<!-- here -->
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* Valid Tags
#+BEGIN_NOTES
mention that these are the tags the go under the launch tag
#+END_NOTES
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =node= | launches a node |
| =param= | sets up a parameter for that node|
| =remap= | remap a topic name to something else |
| =rosparam= | enables the use of YAML files for setting lots of parameters |
| =include= | includes and launches other roslaunch files |
| =env= | specify and environment variable |
| =arg= | sets a variable that can be used in the rest of the launch file |
| =group= | allows you to group nodes in a single launch file |

* <node>
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =name= | the name given to that instance of a node |
| =pkg= | the package that the node is in |
| =type= | The package to launch |
| =args= | arguments to pass to node |
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
	<node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE" .../>

	<node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE">
		<!-- tags local to this node -->
	</node>
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* <param>
| tag | usage |
|-------+------|
| =name= | the name of the parameter |
| =type= | the variable type |
| =value= | the value of the parameter |
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<launch>
	<node name="NODE_NAME" pkg="PKG_NAME" type="NODE_TYPE">
		<param name="PARAM_NAME" type="VAR_TYPE" value="VALUE">
	</node>
</launch>
#+END_SRC

* Substitution arguments
- $(env =ENV_VAR=)
	- will set the value from environment variable
	- will fail if =ENV_VAR= is not set
- $(opentv =ENV_VAR= =default_value=)
	- will set the value from environment variable if set
	- will set default if =ENV_VAR= is not defined
- $(find =PKG_NAME=)
	- used for relative paths to files in packages
- $(arg =ARG_NAME=)
	- will set to =ARG_NAME= if it is defined in file

* Useful Commandline Arguments
| option | effect |
|-------+------|
| =--screen= | force node output to screen |
| =--dump-params= | print parameters in yaml format |
| =--nodes= | prints the nodes launched by this launch file |
| =--args= | prints the command line arguments set in launch file |

* Gazebo
- The simulator used be both RoboRacing and IGVC

* Simulation
#+BEGIN_NOTES
talk about how it crashes. Also that we can simulate friction, mass, etc
#+END_NOTES
- simulators are wonderful
- allow to test code in somewhat real life situations
- not a ROS product
	- interacts with ROS through plugins that publish to topics
	- these plugins are not perfect so it crashes *a lot*

* Package Structure
- =TEAM_NAME_Description=
	- contains the URDF file
- =TEAM_NAME_Control=
	- contains the nodes that control the environment

* URDF
- unified robot description format
- this is what gazebo uses to generate the robot
- XML file format
- defines everything in a 3-dimensional grid

* URDF Components
- <robot> encompassing tag
- made up of things called links

* Links
#+BEGIN_NOTES
take about what each is and how meshes can be used as geometries. visual is required
#+END_NOTES
- links contain
	- *visual geometry*
	- collision geometry
	- intertial geometry

* Links Basic Example
make sure to launch rviz with this urdf
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<robot>
  <link name="base_link">
	<visual>
	  <geometry>
		<box size="0.8 0.3 0.1"/>
	  </geometry>
	</visual>
  </link>
</robot>
#+END_SRC

* Gazebo Link
#+BEGIN_NOTES
launch this in gazebo
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<link name="body">
  <inertial>
	<origin xyz="0 0 0" />
	<mass value="50.0" />
	<inertia  ixx="0.0" ixy="0.0"  ixz="1.0"  iyy="0.0"  iyz="0.0"  izz="0.0" />
  </inertial>
  <visual>
	<origin rpy="0 0 0" xyz="0 0 0"/>
	<geometry>
	  <mesh filename="model://urdf/meshes/Body.dae"/>
	</geometry>
  </visual>
  <collision>
	<geometry>
	  <mesh filename="model://urdf/meshes/Body.dae"/>
	</geometry>
  </collision>
</link>
#+END_SRC
* Joints
- links can be connected using joints
	- all joints have a parents and a child
- all positions are realtive to its parents
	- tree should have a single root

* TODO I AM ROOT

* Joint Types
| type | usage |
|-------+------|
| =continuous= | rotates in an axis and has to limits |
| =fixed= | does not move |
| =floating= | 6 degrees of freedom |
| =revolute= | rotates on an axis and has rotation limits |
* Example Joint
#+BEGIN_SRC XML
<joint name="base_link_to_left_wheel" type="continuous">
	<parent link="base_link"/>
	<child link="left_wheel"/>
	<axis xyz="0 0 -1" rpy="0 0 0" />
	<origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
</joint>
#+END_SRC
* Introducing HAL
* Useful Commands
- =check_urdf=
